std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::shared_ptr<StorageService>>> storage_service_hierarchy;

storage_service_selector["Host1"] = {ss_1, ss_global};
storage_service_selector["Host2"] = {ss_2, ss_global};


submitJob(...., storage_service_hierarchy);


Option #1:
    - Augment submitJob with storage service hierarchy argument
        - Workunit executor deals with and DOES the caching

Option #2:
    - Do a fork of WRENCH with a few horrible lines of code in HTCondorNegotiator
        - Filter and resort the file_location map
        - Copy the input file synchronously to the according storage_service

Option #3:
    - Implement a beautiful simulation of XrootD and the Proxy service for caching
